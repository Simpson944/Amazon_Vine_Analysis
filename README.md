### Conclusion:
There appears to be a slight bias towards providing a positive review based on the fact that the individual was paid to provide it. Analysis of different product types that target different demographics may be helpful in determining if this bias is reflected in those other demographics (tools were selected for this round, it would be interesting to see if cosmetic reviews yeilded the same result)
